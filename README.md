To create this website, I downloaded an html template from Free CSS and edited the template to include my information and to change the colors so they matched the University of Iowa black and gold rather than the pinkish theme that was present at the start. All the files have been validated using standards from html5, css3, and WCAG 2,1 standards, level AA standards for accessibility. Following completion of the pages, the files were deployed to Microsoft Azure were it was built as a static web app, I think connected the domain name I secured earlier in the semester to replace the given url from Azure. Following this, I connected my website to google analytics where I am able to measure website viewers and determine any trends about the viewers.
