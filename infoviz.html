              <p>For my Information Visualization project, Jack and I were given the responsibility of telling a story using Tableau visualizations and a Tableau story. We chose to look into the Olympics as the summer of 2024 will see the Paris games, and we both are big on supporting our fellow Americans when they represent the Stars and Stripes at the Olympic Games. The data source for this project was also from  <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/" title="Our dataset source">Kaggle</a>, although the author has since deleted the data set or added additional data that was not available when we completed the project.</p>
              <p>We looked into how the games have evolved and our data ran from the 1896 games to the 2016 summer games in Rio. We thought that showing the number of participants was an effective way to show how the games have grown and how women made up nearly half of the athletes in the 2016 games after not being allowed to participate until 1900. We also wanted to se if there were any prevailing trends for Olympic medalists or athletes and there was no one trend over the century plus, which could be accounted for in large part due to the sheer variety of competitions. While I could not embed the powerpoint presentation we created, the link to the Tableau public story can be found <a href="https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/samual.starnes/viz/InfoVizOlympicProject/Story1" title="Our story in Tableau">here</a> where the interactivity that we feel is crucial can be properly utilized.
